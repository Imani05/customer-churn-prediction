## Introduction
Customer churn is a critical problem for businesses as it directly impacts revenue and growth. This project aims to develop machine learning models that can effectively predict customer churn based on various features and attributes. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The notebook uses a dataset containing customer information, including demographic details, usage patterns, and other relevant features. The dataset is not included in this repository due to privacy and confidentiality reasons. However, the notebook provides insights into the structure and characteristics of the dataset used for analysis.

## Installation
To run the notebook locally, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the required dependencies. You can install Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions in the official documentation: [Jupyter Notebook Installation Guide](https://jupyter.org/install).

Additionally, the notebook requires the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly
- Yellowbrick

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly yellowbrick
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the notebook file.
2. Open the notebook file (`customer_churn_prediction.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code and view the results.
4. Modify the notebook as needed to experiment with different models or analyze your own dataset.

## Notebook Contents
The notebook is structured into the following sections:
1. Data Overview
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Model Building
   - Baseline Model
   - Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)
   - Recursive Feature Elimination
   - Univariate Selection
   - Various Machine Learning Models
5. Model Performances over the Training Dataset
6. Model Performances over the Principal Test Dataset

Each section contains detailed explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to guide you through the analysis process.

## Results
The notebook evaluates the performance of multiple machine learning models for customer churn prediction. It compares the models using various metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and Cohen's Kappa. The results are presented through confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.

The key findings and insights from the analysis are discussed in the notebook, providing valuable information for businesses to understand customer churn behavior and develop effective retention strategies.
